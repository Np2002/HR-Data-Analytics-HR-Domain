#  Atliq Presence Insights - HR Attendance Dashboard (Power BI)

Welcome to my Power BI project titled **"Atliq Presence Insights"**, which focuses on analyzing employee attendance patterns including work-from-home (WFH) trends and sick leave (SL) distribution. This project was created to strengthen my data visualization, Power BI, and storytelling skills as a fresher in data analytics.

##  Project Objective

- Track and monitor employee attendance metrics across months
- Analyze trends in WFH and SL (Sick Leave) patterns
- Identify attendance behavior by day of the week and individual performance
- Build an interactive HR dashboard for stakeholder reporting

## Insights from Dashboard

- Tuesday and Wednesday show the highest WFH percentages
- Monday has a slightly higher SL rate than other days
- Most employees have over 90% attendance, with some showing higher WFH activity
- Significant drops in attendance on specific dates (e.g., public holidays or patterns)

## Tools & Skills Applied

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** for data transformation (unpivoting, renaming, date formatting)
